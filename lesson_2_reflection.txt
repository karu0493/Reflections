What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Ans : To initialize git to my work.
Ex : git init
Ex: git - status >>>>> Gives the status of untracked files from last commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Ans : Staging area is an intermediate place where we place our files which needs to be committed. Staging area makes it easier to put in logical changes and give a good message to our commit.
Ex : git add {Filename} >> add file to staging area
     git add {Filename1} >> add file1 to staging area
     git status >>> shows which files are in staging area(ready to commit) and which files are not tracked.
